YOUR GARDEN WON‘T NOTICE YOU‘RE GONE. BECAUSE YOU WON‘T BE
The GARDENA smart system gives you the control you want and your garden the attention it needs. With the GARDENA smart system you have the power to keep your garden growing wherever you are.

SPRINKLERS OFF, LIGHT AND FOUNTAIN ON
You like water – and so does your garden. As soon as your garden‘s thirst has been quenched, on comes the water feature next to your terrace. Both the water feature and its light turn on as part of a fully automated process, setting the mood for your relaxed evening.

IT’S 6 AM – TIME TO WATER THE PLANTS
Relax, water your plants the smart way: in a fully automated process and only when your plants actually need it. Early in the morning, the soil has cooled down overnight, less water evaporates than if applied to hot ground. The plants are able to take up sufficient water in good time before the day warms up.

LET YOUR PLANTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
Sometimes it‘s easier to just listen – because thanks to the smart Sensor, your plants have a voice. Stay up-to-date with the latest information from your garden, directly on your smartphone.
